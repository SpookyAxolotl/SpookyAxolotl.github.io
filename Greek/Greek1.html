		<h1>Greek Mythology</h1>

		<h3>Throughout greek, there has been lore surrounding the likeness in gods and their religion's view. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of myth-making itself.</h3>

		<h3>Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature. Apart from the stories told about greek mythology, representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes were featured in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts.</h3>

		<h3>While there have been many depictions on the greek gods, some where lost under the cracks and were depicted into their own ideliations and point of view. The aspect that society have switched is their point of origin and whether or not they were justifiable as evil or good. In my research, I have noticed four people that have been depicted as something else instead of their original action.</h3>

		<h3>The gods I will be explaining their original entirely are <a href="Greek2.html">Hades</a>, <a href="Greek3.html"> Aphrodite</a>, <a href="Greek4.html"> Ares</a>, and <a href="Greek5.html"> Athena</a>. These are some of the gods who have been portrayed differently around society due to their job and what they should be acting like. </h3>
