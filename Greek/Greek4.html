		<h1>Greek Mythology Ares</h1>

		<a href="Greek1.html">Home</a>, <a href="Greek2.html"> Hades</a>, <a href="Greek3.html"> Aphrodite</a>, <a href="Greek5.html"> Athena</a>. 

		<h3>Ares is known for being the Greek God of War, Courage and bloodlust. He is the son of Zeus and Hera and brothers to many affair children of Zeus. Ares is depicted in society as a violent, merciless person who has no care for anyone around but that is nto the case at all. In fact, the same action like hades, he is kind but violent. Ares is the opposite of what his sister is, he is the part of bloodlust but <a href="Greek5.html"> Athena</a> is the goodside of war which is strategy and knowledge</h3>

		<h3>His unpopularity was a result of his love of war and bloodshed for its own sake. Ares was aggressive, and personified the brute nature of war. This is set in stone but he has never hurt a woman or has violated her in all of greek mythology. Ares is one of the gods who has not forced someone into bed and is a mothers boy to hera, the queen of marriage. </h3>

		<h3>In one story, Ares had found out his daughter Alcippe was violated by Halirrhothius. Halirrhothius was the son of Poseidon and Euryte or Bathycelia and once Ares had found out about this, Ares had murdered him and was tried for this murder in court among the other gods. Ares had looked upon the other gods and have stated "I do not regret in the decision I have made. I would do it again to avenge my daughter." He was found not guilty by 3 votes, Zeus and Poseidon had voted guilty and Hades voted nothing because he didn't want to deal with this cause. This act was given that although he is known for his bloodshed in the battlefield, he does not take it home to his family at all. Instead he protects the love of his family and protects any type of woman who has been hurt in ancient greek. </h3>
