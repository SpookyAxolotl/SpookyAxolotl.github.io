		<h1>Greek Mythology Aphrodite</h1>

		<a href="Greek1.html">Home</a>, <a href="Greek2.html"> Hades</a>, <a href="Greek4.html"> Ares</a>, <a href="Greek5.html"> Athena</a>. 

		<h3>Around the centuries with Aphrodite, she is the goddess of love, beauty, lust, pleasure, passion, procreation and also the goddess of war. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess and was even participating during the Trojan war. She doesn't care much around the consequences she causes, she is also impulsive and too overprotective to her children and even prone to jealousy around mortal humans who might be more beautiful than her. While also being the Goddess of love, beauty and war, she has not kept a reputation into being loyal to her spouse. She has cheated on Hephaestus with his brother Ares because of some sources on how "ugly" he is and it was an arrange marriage.</h3>

		<h3>Aphrodite is unhappy when it comes to mortals who avoid relationships at all, explained in the story of Hippolytus. Hippolytus was a rare male hunter of Artemis, the goddess of hunt, wild animals, vegetatoon and of chastity and childbirth. He did not want to deal with any relationships or sexual nature (aro-ace just like artemis) and only focusing on being a hunter. Long story short, Aphrodite had made the man's step-mother fall in love with him but he refused and his step-mother commanded his father to kill him for "inappropriately" touching her. </h3>

		<h3>While Aphrodite has done some terriple things, she does not mind having to help people who are trying to find love like in the story of Pygmalion and Atalanta. Another action is how society have changed Aphrodite into being skinny and curvy while in her statue she is very plumped and not skinny at the slightest. Back in ancient greek, being chubby and having some fat inside you meant you have been fed well and were depicted as beautiful. </h3>
